    <h1>Google Font:</h1>
    <p>
        The directory was launched in 2010 and revamped in 2011 and 2016. Most of the fonts are released under
        the SIL Open Font License 1.1, while some are released under the Apache License; both are libre licenses.
        The font library is also distributed by Monotype’s SkyFonts and Adobe’s Edge Web Fonts and Typekit services.
<br><br>
        The Google Fonts directory is intended to enable font discovery and exploration, and the service is used
        extensively with over 17 trillion fonts served, which means that each of its 877 fonts has been downloaded over
        19 billion times, which means that each person on Earth has, on average, downloaded each font at least two or
        three times. Popular fonts include Open Sans, Roboto, Lato, Slabo 27px, Oswald and Lobster.
